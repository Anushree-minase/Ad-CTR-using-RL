Explanation-
We have n slot machines. When we play a slot machine, it provides us a reward (negative or positive) according
to some fixed probability distribution. Each machine may have a different probability distribution, and we don't know the
distributions ahead of time. So, we want to maximize the amount of reward (money) we get.
